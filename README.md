# LS Photography

LS Photography is a personal photography portfolio, a showcase of my journey and passion for capturing moments through the lens. This repository contains the source code for a personal photography portfolio web application built with a Ruby on Rails backend, a React frontend utilizing Material-UI (MUI) for styling, and PostgreSQL as the database.
